# FGO Banners by Servant for the EN/Global server
A collated, correlated list of projected banners for the global/EN/NA version of FGO based on existing data of JP banners. Data is sourced directly from the community-maintained Banners by Servant public spreadsheet, located at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rKtRX3WK9ZpbEHhDTy7yGSxYWIav1Hr_KhNM0jWN2wc/edit

No existing stacks or frameworks used, just some CSS, HTML, and a ton of vanilla Javascript.
